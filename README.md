# How to use this script
1. Create a folder in Workspace called Checkpoints it is case sensitive so make sure it's the exact way I have it ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/701d84aa-ddd5-4492-8746-c48af799e517)
3. add how ever many parts you want and order then starting from 1 to whatever make sure the names are 1, 2, 3 etc ...
4. Go to ServerScriptService and paste the script in there in the image you will see a folder called handlers you don't need that ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ae8ccd-9afe-4eea-8d71-f356748b7306)
5. Enjoy
